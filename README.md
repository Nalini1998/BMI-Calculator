# BMI Calculator

This code is a BMI _(Body Mass Index)_ calculator. It uses two range sliders to input the user's height and weight, and calculates their BMI when the "Calculate" button is clicked. 

The resulting BMI value and corresponding weight status _("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", or "Obese")_ are displayed in the results section. The code also includes styling and gradient effects for the range sliders and background of the weight status text.
